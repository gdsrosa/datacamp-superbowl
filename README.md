## Super Bowl and Halftime Data

This repo is about a final project of Intermediate Python course on DataCamp.

And here is some questions that this analysis will answer it:
 - What are the most extreme game outcomes?
 - How does the game affect television viewership?
 - How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
 - Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
